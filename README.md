Welcome to my Monogame Player interface.

Using monogame + Node.js + MongoDB I have created an interface where you can add, delete, and update player info. I had trouble trying to run in visual studio so I went with Visual studio code to run both my backend and frontend. Steps I took to make possible->

To Run:

1. Install NPM dependencies inside backend terminal. (Your terminal should look like this--> PS C:\MonogameApi\backend>--Add dependencies here--)

2. Install monogame inside Visual studio code whether through github or extensions.---MAY NOT BE NECCESSARY if you make project inside visual studio and open folder in VSC

3. .net for windows and C# dev kit ([DotNet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) && [CdevKit](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dotnettools.csdevkit))

4. Run node server 2 ways:
    1. Inside MonogameApi terminal type "node backend/app.js"
    2. Inside MonogameApi/backend terminal type "node app.js"
    You should see a connection to port and database.

5. Now hit F5 to start the application or go to game1.cs inside /frontend and run file.
